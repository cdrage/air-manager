## Bombardier CRJ-Pedestal-Audio Control Panel
- **v1.0** 09-27-2022
    - Original Panel Created


##Left To Do:
    - RTIC Switch is currently a 3 position knob. Should probably change it to touch zones instead.
	
##Notes:
    - If using a knobster, the outer knob will turn the volume dials and the inner knob will toggle the mute. The knobster push button doesn't do anything. This is because the mute toggle is a switch and not a button.
    - This instrument has a user prop to control either the Pilot, CoPilot or Lower unit.
