## Left To Do:
  - N/A
	
## Notes:
  - The Alt Knob has an outer and inner dials. Outer changes 1000' increments, Inner 100' increments. 
  - The VS Speed knob is difficult to use without a knobster. Thus there is a user prop to make the dial two buttons (Down/Up).   
  - The CRS1 and CRS2 knobs control NAV1 and NAV2 respectively. This is different compared to the Virtural Cockpit as of v0.12.11 where either knob controls either NAV.
