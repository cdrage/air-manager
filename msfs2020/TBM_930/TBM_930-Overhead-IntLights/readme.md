## TBM 930 Overhead IntLights
- **v1.0**  01-21-2022  SIMSTRUMENTATION
    - Original Panel Created


## Left To Do:
    - Dimmer/Cabin/Access Switches don't work after SU5. Variables not read/writeable.
    	
## Notes:
    - The knobster is not aware of state and can allow you to turn past a position. Thus 
      it's possible to turn the panel lights off if you quickly turn the knob clockwise. 
      Unknown how to avoid this.
      
    - If using mixMugz the Panel Dimmer Knob may have to be turned first in the cockpit 
      before it's reconginized by AirManager.
