## TBM 930 Overhead EngineStart+Fuel
- **v1.0**  01-21-2022 SIMSTRUMENTATION
    - Original Panel Created


## Left To Do:
    - 
    	
## Notes:
    - As of 1-20-22 Starter switch in VC (SIM Virtural Cockpit) moves to ON for 3 seconds then moves to OFF 
      and doesn't allow you to turn starter OFF. This panel is working correctly and does allow starter to be turned off.
    - Ignition switch in VC does not move.
    - Fuel SEL is INOP due to commands not available. This is a sim limitation unfortunately.
